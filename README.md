# snake_python_pygame

**How to install and launch the game ?**

- Install the zip package "bilhox_snake"
- Unzip the package
- Launch the file "main.py" , you must have installed before the Python interpreter and the Pygame module (all here : https://www.python.org/downloads/ and https://pypi.org/project/pygame/ )

( In the V1.3 of the game , I added a cmd launcher file , you need to have Python +3.9 to use it !)
